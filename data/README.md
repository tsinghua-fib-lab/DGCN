# Data Preprocessing

We provide a script `taobao.py` to preprocess the Taobao dataset.
You can modify this script to process other datasets.

Notice that we use several helper functions in another repo [dps](https://github.com/DavyMorgan/dps) to process the data.
Thus you need to clone this repo and add the path properly as in Lines 7-9 of `taobao.py`.
